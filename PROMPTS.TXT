update the product_categories with a column titled "child_categories" which will be an array of UUID's that match the id of categories that are children of a parent category.  A parent category will get child categories if it's UUID matches the parent variable in the create_product_category_handler function in the handler.rs file.  Update the database, model.rs and handler.rs accordingly
